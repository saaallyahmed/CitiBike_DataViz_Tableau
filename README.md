 Citi Bike Analytics



Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implemented a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. The task is to to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
